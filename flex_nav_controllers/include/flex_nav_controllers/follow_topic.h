/**
 * @class FollowTopic
 * @brief An extension of base_local_planner that follows generated Paths
 *
 *   FollowTopic accepts Paths generated by a Flex Planner that were published
 *   on a topic. FollowTopic also has the ability to clear the local cost map
 *   by sending a ClearCostmapAction. The published Paths are accepted by way
 *   of a FollowTopicAction that instructs the node to subscribe to a planner's
 *   Path topic. The ability to clear the local cost map is accessible through
 *   the `clear_costmap` topic.
